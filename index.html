      he iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc.
      that use Apple's iOS mobile operating system. The first-generation iPhone
      was announced by former Apple CEO Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since
      then, Apple has annually released new iPhone models and iOS updates. As of
      November 1, 2018, more than 2.2 billion iPhones had been sold. The iPhone
      has a user interface built around a multi-touch screen. It connects to
      cellular networks or Wi-Fi, and can make calls, browse the web, take
      pictures, play music and send and receive emails and text messages. Since
      the iPhone's launch further features have been added, including larger
      screen sizes, shooting video, waterproofing, the ability to install
      third-party mobile apps through an app store, and many accessibility
      features. Up to 2017, iPhones used a layout with a single button on the
      front panel that returns the user to the home screen. Since 2017, more
      expensive iPhone models have switched to a nearly bezel-less front screen
      design with app switching activated by gesture recognition.

      Apple Watch is a line of smartwatches produced by Apple Inc. It
      incorporates fitness tracking, health-oriented capabilities, and wireless
      telecommunication, and integrates with iOS and other Apple products and
      services. The Apple Watch was released in April 2015[30][31] and quickly
      became the best-selling wearable device: 4.2 million were sold in the
      second quarter of fiscal 2015,[32][33] and more than 100 million people
      were estimated to use an Apple Watch as of December 2020.[34] Apple has
      introduced new generations of the Apple Watch with improved internal
      components each September[35][36][37][38]—each labeled by Apple a
      'Series', with certain exceptions.[a]

      AirPods are wireless Bluetooth earbuds designed by Apple. They were first
      announced on September 7, 2016, with a second generation announced and
      released in March 2019. They are Apple's entry-level wireless headphones,
      sold alongside the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max. Within two years, they
      became Apple's most popular accessory.[2][3] In addition to playing audio,
      the AirPods contain a microphone that filters out background noise as well
      as built-in accelerometers and optical sensors capable of detecting taps
      (e.g. double-tap to pause audio) and placement within the ear, which
      enables automatic pausing of audio when they are taken out.[4] On March
      20, 2019, Apple released the second-generation AirPods, which feature the
      H1 chip, longer talk time, and hands-free "Hey Siri" support. An optional
      wireless charging case which costs extra was added in the offerings.

      MacBook Air (2008–present) and the MacBook Pro (2006–present). Two
      different lines simply named "MacBook" existed from 2006 to 2012 and 2015

      and MacBook Pro incorporating the new Apple M1 system on a chip. Apple
