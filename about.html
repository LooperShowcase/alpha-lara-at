    <h1>About Apple</h1>
    <p>
      Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company that
      specializes in consumer electronics, computer software, and online
      services. Apple is the world's largest technology company by revenue
      (totaling $274.5 billion in 2020) and, since January 2021, the world's
      most valuable company. As of 2021, Apple is the world's fourth-largest PC
      vendor by unit sales,[9] and fourth-largest smartphone
      manufacturer.[10][11] It is one of the Big Five American information
      technology companies, along with Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and
      Facebook.[12][13][14] Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and
      Ronald Wayne in 1976 to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal
      computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc.
      in 1977, and sales of its computers, including the Apple II, grew quickly.
      It went public in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few
      years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative graphical user
      interfaces, such as the original Macintosh, announced with the critically
      acclaimed advertisement "1984". However, the high price of its products
      and limited application library caused problems, as did power struggles
      between executives. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably,[15] while
      Jobs resigned to found NeXT, taking some Apple co-workers with him.[16] As
      the market for personal computers expanded and evolved through the 1990s,
      Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of
      Microsoft Windows on Intel PC clones. The board recruited CEO Gil Amelio,
      who prepared the struggling company for eventual success with extensive
      reforms, product focus and layoffs in his 500-day tenure. In 1997, Amelio
      bought NeXT, to resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating system strategy and
      bring back Steve Jobs, who replaced Amelio as CEO later that year. Apple
      returned to profitability under the revitalizing "Think different"
      campaign, launching the iMac and iPod, opening a retail chain of Apple
      Stores in 2001, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden their software
      portfolio. In 2007, the company launched the iPhone to critical acclaim
      and financial success. In 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health
      complications, and died two months later. He was succeeded by Tim Cook. In
      August 2018, Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be
      valued at over $1 trillion[17][18] and the first valued over $2 trillion
      two years later.[19][20] It has a high level of brand loyalty and is
      ranked as the world's most valuable brand; as of January 2021, there are
      1.65 billion Apple products in use worldwide.[21] However, the company
      receives significant criticism regarding the labor practices of its
      contractors, its environmental practices, and business ethics, including
      anti-competitive behavior and materials sourcing.

    <h1>its apple park</h1>
    <p>
      Apple Park is the corporate headquarters of Apple Inc., located in
      Cupertino, California. It was opened to employees in April 2017, while
      construction was still underway, and superseded the original headquarters
      at 1 Infinite Loop, which opened in 1993.[7] The main building's scale and
      circular groundscraper design, by Norman Foster,[8] have earned the
      structure a media nickname "the spaceship".[9][10][11] Located on a
      suburban site totalling 1.46 km2, it houses more than 12,000 employees in
      one central four-story circular building of approximately 0.26 km2. Apple
      co-founder Steve Jobs wanted the campus to look less like a business park
      and more like a nature refuge. Eighty percent of the site consists of
      green space planted with drought-resistant trees and plants indigenous to
      the Cupertino area, and the center courtyard of the main building features
      an artificial pond.[11]
