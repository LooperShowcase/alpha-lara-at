      Apple (AAPL) officially launched its next-generation iPhone 13 line on
      Friday, with four new smartphones hitting shelves and shipping to
      customers who secured their orders early. Last week, the company showed
      off its latest devices -- the iPhone 13 mini, the iPhone 13, the iPhone 13
      Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max, as well as a new iPad, iPad mini and Apple
      Watch -- at a closely-watched media event. Not long after iPhone
      pre-orders went live three days later, estimated arrival times for some
      models slipped to October or November. (The Apple Watch is not yet
      available for purchase.)
